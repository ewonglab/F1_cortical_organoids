### Generating mouse strain-specific genomes

Strain-specific variant call files were downloaded from the Mouse Genome Project repository - https://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/mousegenomes/REL-1505-SNPs_Indels/strain_specific_vcfs/ - including:
| Indels | SNPs |
| ------ | ---- |
| CAST_EiJ.mgp.v5.indels.dbSNP142.normed.vcf.gz | CAST_EiJ.mgp.v5.snps.dbSNP142.vcf.gz |
| MOLF_EiJ.mgp.v5.indels.dbSNP142.normed.vcf.gz | MOLF_EiJ.mgp.v5.snps.dbSNP142.vcf.gz |
| PWK_PhJ.mgp.v5.indels.dbSNP142.normed.vcf.gz  | PWK_PhJ.mgp.v5.snps.dbSNP142.vcf.gz  |
| SPRET_EiJ.mgp.v5.indels.dbSNP142.normed.vcf.gz | SPRET_EiJ.mgp.v5.snps.dbSNP142.vcf.gz |

    
We used C57BL/6J mouse genome (GRCm38, release 68) as a reference genome.
